# Facebook Comment Scraper

A high-performance toolkit for extracting comments from Facebook posts using Selenium and JavaScript automation.

## üìã Overview

This project provides multiple scripts for scraping comments from Facebook posts, each optimized for different scenarios:

- **scraper.py** - Standard version with balanced performance and reliability.
- **scraper-fast.py** - Performance-optimized version with timing metrics.
- **scraper-turbo.py** - Maximum-speed version using JavaScript injection.
- **scraper-replies.py** - Specialized version for capturing comment threads.

## üöÄ Features

- **Speed-optimized collection**: Get comments 5-10x faster than manual browsing.
- **Performance metrics**: Built-in timer to measure execution speed of each phase.
- **JavaScript automation**: Uses browser's native JavaScript for faster DOM traversal.
- **Parallel processing**: Multi-threaded comment extraction and processing.
- **Resource optimization**: Blocks unnecessary resources for faster page loads.
- **Robust error handling**: Deals with Facebook's dynamic layout changes.
- **CSV export**: Automatically saves comments with timestamps.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/icecubes99/Scraper-Test.git
   cd Scraper-Test
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Make sure you have the Chrome browser installed.

## üìä Usage

### Standard Scraper

Best for general-purpose comment extraction with good reliability.

### Fast Scraper (with performance metrics)

Optimized for speed with built-in performance tracking.

### Turbo Scraper (JavaScript-accelerated)

Uses JavaScript injection for maximum speed when extracting large numbers of comments.

### Replies Scraper

Specialized for extracting both comments and their replies.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Modify these variables in each script to customize behavior:

- **Post URL**: Update the `fb_post_url` variable with the target Facebook post URL.
- **Maximum Comments**: Adjust the `MAX_COMMENTS` variable to set the limit for comment extraction.

## üß© How It Works

1. **Initialization**: Sets up a Chrome browser with optimized settings.
2. **Navigation**: Opens the target Facebook post.
3. **Interaction**: Clicks "View more comments" buttons and scrolls to load content.
4. **Extraction**: Collects comments using various selector patterns.
5. **Processing**: Cleans and processes raw comment text.
6. **Export**: Saves processed comments to a timestamped CSV file.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Performance Comparison

| Script Version | Comments Per Minute | Memory Usage | CPU Usage |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Standard       | ~100-200            | Medium       | Medium    |
| Fast           | ~300-500            | Low          | Medium    |
| Turbo          | ~500-1000+          | Low          | High      |
| Replies        | ~50-100             | Medium       | Low       |

## üìà Output Example

The scrapers generate CSV files with this format:

| Comment Number | Comment Text                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1              | This is a sample comment.                  |
| 2              | Another example comment with more details. |

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **No comments found**:

  - Try running without headless mode (remove the `--headless` option).
  - Check if the post URL is correct and publicly accessible.
  - Facebook may have changed their HTML structure; update the selectors.

- **Slow performance**:

  - Adjust the scroll delay values in the script.
  - Ensure your internet connection is stable.
  - Try using `scraper-turbo.py` for better performance.

- **Script crashes**:

  - Update ChromeDriver and Selenium to the latest versions.
  - Check for changes in Facebook's HTML structure.
  - Look for specific error messages in the output.

- **Empty comments**:
  - Check the comment processing function filters.
  - Make sure the post has public comments.

### Selector Maintenance

Facebook frequently changes its DOM structure. If the scraper stops working, you may need to update these patterns:

- Use browser developer tools to inspect the current structure and update accordingly.

## üìù Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for a complete list of dependencies.

### Core Requirements:

- Python 3.8+
- Selenium 4.10.0+
- Chrome browser
- `webdriver-manager` 3.9.0+

## üß™ Advanced Usage

### Batch Processing

To scrape multiple posts, create a file with URLs and use a loop to process each URL.

### Headful Mode

To see the browser in action (helpful for debugging), remove the `--headless` option in the Chrome options.

### Custom Output Format

To export to formats other than CSV, modify the export logic in the script.
